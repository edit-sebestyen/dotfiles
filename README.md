## Install

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

These are **my** dotfiles, so please feel free to take anything you want but do so **at your own risk**. üôÇ You should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove the things you don‚Äôt want or need. Don‚Äôt blindly use stuff unless you know what that entails.

### Clone with Git

On a fresh install of macOS, run:

```
# This will ensure all updates are done and the installs the necessary Xcode tools
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
xcode-select --install
```

Then clone the repo:

```
# Clone in a `.dotfiles` folder as all scripts will reference it
git clone https://github.com/radum/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Update the `git/extra.sh` file that looks like this:

```
# Not in the repository, to prevent people from accidentally committing under my name
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Radu Micu"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="radu.micu@gmail.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Temporary step ZSH install

Install zsh manually first and make sure its the default shell, then run the install script.

I think I need to make the setup a 2 step process to install zsh run it and the fire again the install script.


And run `scripts/bootstrap.sh`:

```
source ~/.dotfiles/scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

### Fonts

To be able to see al glyphs and still use the font we like we need to patch the font and add the missing glyphs.

This can be done with [Nerd fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts). Nerd Fonts is a project that patches developer targeted fonts with a high number of glyphs (icons). Specifically to add a high number of extra glyphs from popular 'iconic fonts' such as Font Awesome ‚û∂, Devicons ‚û∂, Octicons ‚û∂, and others.

Pick the one you like and use it in your terminal.
