## VIM Install script

For some reason the vim install script breaks the bootstrap flow. Doing so all the next install script will not run.

I have renamed for now the install script to init.sh so we can run it manually after bootsrap runs.

## Travis is failing without errors

I don't know why this is happening at the moment.
